# Vibe Scholarship: Accessible Academia or Intellectual Fraud?

For better or worse, one of the terms of the informatic Zeitgeist of 2025 is 'vibe coding' [@andrej_karpathy_how_2025, @meske_vibe_2025]. Sometimes pilloried as part of a wider shift towards a mediatic world of 'AI slop', the term registers one of the effects of artificial intelligence: the erasure of an epistemic boundary that had previously cordoned off a complex formal activity for those possessing a particular expertise. Such expertise is usually acquired via channels of professional induction: the university, the occupational apprenticeship, or the institutional certificate. Software engineering has historically been one such field, although as terms like 'hacking' and 'coding' suggest, it is a professional activity marked by relative porous borders demarcating its own formality.

What about the domain of scholarship? Can artificial intelligence – in particular, large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude or DeepSeek – be applied to similar purposes in a field that has sought to maintain, via practices of peer review, citation curation, and journal quality management, much tighter control over who and what is permitted through its gates? Conversely – since it is already clear that LLM use is rife within academia – can that use be legitimate and if so how?

Borrowing from Karpathy [-@Karpathy2025How], this article introduces the idea of 'vibe scholarship'. The idea as it is proposed here exists on a tightrope: it is motivated, on the one hand, by the affordances of LLMs to, as it were, sketch, model and map out scholarship contributions; and it  survives, on the other,  if it can be distinguished from the ghost of plagiarism that for many haunts any mention of AI in academic contexts [@Gaines2025Research]. 

What is vibe scholarship, and how can it be distinguished from related terms like 'vibe research' [@Gullett2025, @Bertina2025VibeResearch]? Meske et al. formalize 'vibe coding' as: 

> Vibe coding is a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. [@Meske2025Vibe] 

An equivalent definition of vibe scholarship could be hazarded as follows:

> Vibe scholarship is an approach to academic work where humans and generative AI collaborate to co-create knowledge through natural language dialogue, with emphasis on that collaboration being *gestural*, *simulated*, and *granular*.

This definition modifies several properties of Meske et al's. Critically, the question of mediation of intent is dropped - or perhaps, deferred – as the distinction between *artefacts* (software or otherwise) and *knowledge* in part involves the very question of *determination*. 

Equally important, three properties are added, designed to demarcate vibe scholarship from plagiarism. The first involves the idea of LLM support for scholarship at a *gestural* level: as a tool for indicating, mapping out, sketching, drafting, thinking aloud, without committing to one or another specific path. The second involves LLM use as a tool for simulation: for practicing, rehearsing, anticipating, enacting research in a way that thinks about some of its possibilities and pitfalls before these eventuate. The third invoves LLM use at a fine rather than coarse-grained level: most obviously, not using LLMs to write whole arguments – or indeed any part of an eventual contribution – but rather to work at the most applied level of scholarship. The more evident examples here might be pre-AI computer tool support for scholarship, in the form of checking spelling and grammar, formating citations, or producing graphs based on quantitative or qualitative data. 

In the remainder of this article, this definition is used to describe how 'vibe scholarship' can be used to characterise legitimate and indeed generative use of AI in academic research, with particular emphasis on the types of qualitative and quantitative research carried out in the social sciences. 



### Lifecycle of Research

Vibe scholarship is discussed here in relation to what is often treated, in varied ways, as the lifecycle of social research in classic and widely cited methodology texts [@booth_craft_2009, bryman, yin, braun_and_clark]. Though approaches naturally vary, common features of social research include
