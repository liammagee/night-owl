Hi! How can I help with lecture-3.md? I can proofread, tighten structure, check citations/translation accuracy, draft learning objectives and discussion questions, or turn this into slide notes.Quick wins I noticed:- Typos/consistency:  - “stoicisim” → “stoicism”; “scepticism” vs “skepticism” (pick one); “Arbeit macht frie” → “Arbeit macht frei”.  - “selfconsciousness” vs “self-consciousness” (hyphenate consistently).  - “Rossum’s Universal Robots” is often abbreviated R.U.R.; author is Karel Čapek (with háček), and “robot/robota” means “forced labor/drudgery” rather than literally “slave” (worth a nuance note).  - You alternate “Phenomenology of Mind” and “Phenomenology of Spirit.” Choose one translation and keep it consistent; most contemporary citations use “Spirit” (Pinkard; Miller).  - “super-ego” → “superego” (standard psychoanalytic spelling).- Terminology: decide on “Master–Slave,” “Lord–Bondsman,” or “Master–Servant” and stick to it; you may add a brief note about why you chose the term.- Citations: you quote paras 161–196; add a reference line indicating the edition (e.g., Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, trans. Pinkard 2018, with paragraph numbers). Note that paragraph numbers may differ slightly across editions.- German terms: italicize and gloss consistently (e.g., Aufhebung as “sublation” with preserve/cancel/lift; Bildung as “formation/education”).- Accessibility: add alt text/captions for images; a short descriptive caption will help.If helpful, I can:- Produce a 120–150 word abstract and 4–6 learning objectives.- Draft 6–8 discussion questions connecting Hegel to AI (e.g., recognition vs RLHF, training vs learning).- Create a slide outline with speaker notes for each section.- Standardize quotations and add inline references.- Write a concise sidebar on the etymology of “robot” and its Hegelian resonance.Tell me what you’d like first, or share a target audience and length, and I’ll tailor the edits.
