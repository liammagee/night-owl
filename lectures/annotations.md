**Selected Text:** In two important passages, Strauss went so far as to assert that the dialogue's treatment of the issue makes clear by contrast the great poverty of the modern or social scientific understanding of political affairs.2 The modern attempt to understand political matters is a disaster; even tyranny cannot be recognized as such by "our modern sciences." If this result is, as Strauss often implies it is, the "inevitable result" of modern philosophy itself, then we are "forced" to consider a "restoration of classical social science" (177). Strauss claimed that modern philosophy deliberately turned away from a principled distinction between kings and tyrants with Machiavelli (in a way itself informed by Xenophon's Education of Cyrus), and that a "confrontation" between the Prince and Hiero was a necessary first step in understanding "modern political science" (24-25; 184-185).

**Selected Text:** The 1963 publication in English of Leo Strauss's study of Xenophon's dialogue, Hiero, or Tyrannicus, also contained a critical review of Strauss's interpretation by the French philosopher and civil servant, Alexandre Kojeve, and a "Restatement" of his position by Strauss. This odd triptych, with a complex statement of the classical position on tyranny in the middle, Strauss's defense of classical philosophy on one side, and Kojeve's defense of a radically historicist, revolutionary Hegel on the other, has now been re-edited and re-published. Victor Gourevitch and Michael Roth have added all the extant letters between Strauss and Kojeve written between 1932 and 1965, many of which continue and deepen the exchanges on Xenophon first published in French in 1954. The editors have also reviewed and corrected the translation of Xenophon, and re-translated Kojeve's review.
