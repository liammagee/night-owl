**Selected Text:** "is, the "inevitable result" of modern philosophy itself, then we are "forced" to consider a "restoration of classical social science" (177). Strauss claimed that modern philosophy deliberately turned away from a principled distinction be- tween kings and tyrants with Machiavelli (in a way itself informed by Xeno- phon's Education of Cyrus), and that a "confrontation" between the Prince and Hiero was a necessary first step in understanding "modern political science" (24-25; 184-185).  While such remarks are the principal justification for studying the dialogue, and introduce Strauss's chief concerns, they are not much explored and the contrast between the classical (successful) and modern (failed) understanding of tyranny is approached indirectly. Strauss is clearly dissatisfied with etiological and analytical accounts of the distinctive twentieth-century uses of power by groups or individuals against others or the masses, dissatisfied with the catego- ries "dictatorship" or "fascism" or "totalitarianism." He clearly assumes that to"

**Selected Text:** " modern orientation: neither nature, in the classical or hierarchical sense, nor  history, but precisely the unavailability of such comprehensive standards,  should orient political discussion. This leaves us with the natural individual [or  what results from modern naturalism or from "methodological individualism"]  and so rational egoist or rights based political thought. And another thing that  makes the exchange between Strauss and Kojeve so strikingly unusual is how  confidently they ignore such options in this context.)  Victor Gourevitch and Michael Roth have repolished and restocked these"

**Selected Text:** " Victor Gourevitch and Michael Roth have repolished and restocked these  boxes, producing now a still more layered, complex book by publishing (without  much editing) all the extant letters between Strauss and Kojeve written between  1932 and 1965, many of which continue and deepen the exchanges on Xenophon  first published in French in 1954. (The editors have also reviewed and corrected  the translation of Xenophon, re-translated Kojeve's review, and restored a  crucial, sweeping statement of philosophical principle Strauss had originally  published in the French version and somewhat mysteriously omitted from his  own first English version.) The result is a complex and stimulating book, with  its "parallel dialogue" between the University of Chicago professor and the  3. Worries about pagan hubris, asceticism, the political implications of classical, cyclical views  on temporality (fatalism, the "tragic sense of life," stoic resignation, and so on), or even an under-  lying ancient ressentiment against the human itself, are of course not new, nor limited to traditional  Christian complaints (as the famous charges of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche show). What is so  unusual about Kojeve is that he does not raise such complaints in the name of a traditional post-"
