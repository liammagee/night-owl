EPOL 479: Machine and Human Learning

<!-- @note: This is a note -->This course examines the differences between machine and human learning and the ways in which machines can complement human learning. It examines technical definitions of supervised and unsupervised machine learning, as well as broader views of mechanical intelligence able to replicate or exceed human intelligence. The course will also explore practical applications of learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and other educational tools and critically interrogate the applications of AI in education.
