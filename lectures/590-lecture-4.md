### What We've Covered



 - Week 1: Research Topic & Question
 - Week 2: Method & Recipe for the Literature Review
 - Week 3: Vibe Scholarship - Applying AI to Close & Distant Reading


---

### This Week




 - What I had planned:
   - Finding Your Scholarly Voice: Peers / Audience / Venue / Field 
   - Drafting a section of your review in a *scientific* and *humanities* mode 
   - Literature Review Sample: In the Scientific Mode

 - What we'll actually do:
   - Activity 1: How do the Humanities engage with Literature? Case study of "Can the Subaltern Speak?"
   - Activity 2: Discuss Structuration and Metadiscourse
   - Activity 3: "Vibe Scholarship" - Fast Drafting Review
     - In the Scientific Mode
     - In the Humanities Mode

---

### Keep AI Handy...

 - As we go, it'll be helpful to have your AI of choice open
 - Consider using an AI you're less familiar with
 - Free versions ought to be fine

### Slow Reading with AI: Spivak, *Can the Subaltern Speak?*

 - Why? Complex example of a humanities text. Presumes knowledge of Western philosophy, political debates around representation
 - "Classic" contribution to decolonial, feminist debates. But long, hard to parse / summarize
   - Spivak often criticized for performative contradiction:
     - Argues for universalization of education, including the most excluded (the rural, illiterate, women) - the "subaltern"
     - But references US academia, French & German philosophy, English colonization, old & new Indian scholarship... who can understand her?
 - So... good case study for AI
 - Use the Google Doc to make collective notes as we go
   - Cyber-social Reading? 'Vibe Scholarship' in action?

### Who is Spivak?

[Message from Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak -THE 2012 KYOTO PRIZE - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8iPj6qka3o)
   
[An Aesthetic Education in the Era of Globalization – Gayatri Spivak - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBzCwzvudv0)

 - Hybrid Intellectual:
   - Born and educated in India 
   - Higher ed, later career in the US
   - But a *Europeanist* - translated *Of Grammatology* by Jacques Derrida (1971?)
   - Return to India - the idea of the *subaltern* in education
 - Concerned with the question and meaning of *representation*

### Can the subaltern speak?

Spivak, G. C. (2023). . In *Imperialism* (pp. 171-219). Routledge.

### Group Reading with AI: Some questions (but develop your own)

 - What is "subaltern"? Why this term?
 - What is Spivak *doing* exactly with her literature?
   - *Contra* Foucault and Deleuze? Why? And why use Marx against them?
   - Who else does Spivak assemble in what we might call the "drama" that she stages?  
   - Why no (or few) US scholars? Who are the key French and German figures in her analysis?
   - Who are the Indian scholars, and how are these voices mobilized?
 - What is the significance of the two German translations of representation: *Vorstellung* and *Darstellung*?  

---


### A key quote - what does it mean?

> Conversely, invocations of 'libidinal economy' and desire as the determining interest, combined with the practical politics of the oppressed (under socialized capital) 'speaking for themselves', restore the category of the sovereign subject within the theory that seems most to question it. 

---

### Prompting ideas

 - "Produce an (abstractive / extractive) (critical / descriptive) summary"
 - "Identify the latent structure of the text"
 - "List the key thinkers Spivak invokes - and tell us about her relationship to them"
   - Develop a conceptual map?
 - "Find the most obscure passages or paragraphs"
   - then "Read line-by-line" (for a given paragraph)
 - "Identify and explain German / French / Hindi terms"
 - "Describe the influence of 'Can the Subaltern Speak'"
 - "What would Foucault or Deleuze say in response?"   
 - etc. etc.



---

### Takeaways? 

 - Can AI help us with *slow*, *close*, *deep* reading? Can it help us read *more* than the text before us? 
 - Think of AI as "hypertext 2.0"? "Cybertext"? Palimsestic reading (the texts behind the text)?
 - If we think of terms like intertextuality, autopoesis and Derrida's famous aphorism (first translated by Spivak) "There is nothing outside the text" - was poststructuralism (Derrida, Spivak) correct?

### Structuring Your Literature Review

Pick a **principle**:
 - General > Specific – can confirm but also **contrast** ("General theories of pedagogy suggest... *However* studies of adult language learners also show...")
 - Chronological ("By the 1960s, discussions of AI had already become more muted...")
 - Thematic ("The concept of 'attention' is used in roughly similar ways in machine and human learning...")
 - Spatial ("Studies in Asian universities show that ...; in contrast, findings from North American universities suggest...")
 - Developmental ("First I will discuss Descartes' presentation of the mind/body problem. I then move on to look at 20th century critiques of this distinction....")
 - Other?
 - Nested Categories (chronology then thematic, etc)?


---

### Some Guiding Notes

 - Specialization: Can work well when you want to convey a sense of **narrowing** down a focus: Education > K12 > Math learning > Algebra > in rural Mid-west schools
 - Chronological: Can work well when you want to convey a sense of **progress**
   - And how your work **extends** that progress
 - Thematic: Can work well when you want to convey a sense of **overlaps**, **intersection** and **gaps**
   - And how your work discovers and fills one of these gaps
 - Spatial: Works well when you want to convey a sense of cultural, spatial or geographic difference
   - And how your study attends to a location or zone not previously studied
 - Developmental: Works well when you plan to build your argument through a sequence of positions / thinkers / ideas
   - And show how you will blend, contrast or critique all of these positions / thinkers / ideas 


---

### How do I Decide?

 - Typically iterative:
   - Go forward to discover the gap
   - Move back from the gap to discover the structure
 - Experiment with different structures
   - Mock up your structure (more on this next week)
 
   
---

### Metadiscourse / Signposting 

 - Assume your reader does **not know** the literature
 - A literature review is often **pedagogical** - teaching the reader about a field, in order to persuade them about the gap your research fills
 - Helps **you** in authoring - does Y really follow from X?
 - Be prepared to write / re-write this metadiscursive text often - especially early, as you experiment with structural principles (chronological etc)


---

### Making It Explicit

 - Cannot be too explicit about your structure:
   - Introduction (future tense): 
     - "In this literature review I will..."
     - (or if you prefer) "This review will..."
   - Conclusion (past tense): 
     - "In this review, I have discussed literature relating to..."
     - (or if you prefer) "This review has..."
   - Along the way:
     - "In the last section, I discussed.... In the next, I will..."
     - Can be blended through connective language. "While the *preceding studies* illustrated how use of AI in education has been studied extensively, less has been said about how AI contributes to the student/teacher relationship. Some exceptions include studies by X, Y and Z..."

---

### Develop a Repertoire of Metadiscourse

 - Ask AI for suggestions...
   - "Give me examples of metadiscourse for a literature review"
   - Or "Give me a table and distinguish between metadiscourse used in (a) scientific and (b) humanities discussions of literature

---

### Practice in Groups...

Using 3-6 sources from your database (Week 3), develop:

1. A paragraph of a *scientific* literature review
2. A paragraph of a *humanities* literature review

Make sure to *introduce* and *conclude* the paragraph. **Exaggerate** the scientific and humanities styles – and the metadiscourse!


---

### The *Scientific* literature review

 - What does your **scientific** audience expect?
 - Use [[2510.01171] Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171) - or other examples
 - Write 4-5 sentences - cite 4+ references
 - Use metadiscourse to introduce / compare / contrast / conclude / transition the paragraph
 - 15 minutes?
 - Use Google Doc - **Homework for Week 4**

---

### The *Humanities* literature review

 - What does your **humanities** audience expect?
 - Use Spivak, G. C. (2023). [jan.ucc.nau.edu](https://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~sj6/Spivak%20CanTheSubalternSpeak.pdf) - or other examples
 - Write 4-5 sentences - cite 1+ references
 - Use metadiscourse to introduce / compare / contrast / conclude / transition the paragraph
 - 15 minutes?
 - Use Google Doc - **Homework for Week 4**

---

### Finally

 - Read both versions
 - (Optional) Ask AI to add even more "metadiscourse" to the text

---

### Discuss

 - Which did you prefer to write? Which did you find more persuasive to read?
 - What kind of audience would you usually write for?
 - Could you imagine blending these two extremes?
