Knowledge Revision Components (KReC) framework

 - encoding
 - passive activation
 - co-activation
 - integratin
 - competing activation
 
  - revision = reduction or elimination of the activation of incorrect information (**question**: isn't incorrect information necessary to know correct information)
  - refutation text structure: misconception / refutation / explanation (source)
  - 5k students; 50 studies; 3 languages
  
   - refutation works with *causal* explanation
   - *negative emotions* narrow attention - help revision
   - *source credibility* matters (expertise; trustworthiness)
     - need *explicit prompts* / *instructions*
   - individual differences [epistemic cognition] interact with refutation messages

 - what about multiple documents comprehension?
 - source credibility / text structure > intertextual integration
   - misconception persistence

 - knowledge accuracy
 - AI transformation

### AI personas

 - control "echo"
 - refutation "corrector"
 - refutation "empathizer"

 - knowledge revision: both simple / empathetic refutation are effective
 
 - perceptions, trust of AI
   - helpful, unbiased, clear, trust

 - genAI: misinformation problem & solution
 

  - reduction in conspirational thinking (artifical arguments - Science journal)
  - critical thinking, trust in science

 - psychological mechanisms > effective interventions
 
  - evolving nature of learning
  - competencies: understand, evaluate AI
  
   - Ed-AI framework
