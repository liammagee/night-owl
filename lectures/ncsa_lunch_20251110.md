Illinois computes
Research computing for all

 - Humanities: driver of tech - how do we tease out the relevance of the humanities for a future of generative AI? Lit Crit - Northrop Frye - Words With Power -> understand *deeply* what prompts do.
 - Explainable AI: how do we understand automated decision-making? And what do we mean by 'understand'? 
 - Continuous learning: How do we produce properly symbiotic learning - machines learning from humans, humans learning from machines?
 - Neuro-symbolic: can we mix logical, deductive with probabilistic reasoning? And what does this provide, in terms of rigorous, repeatable inference?
 - Mini / NanoGPT: Intuitions about how AI works for non-technical people
   - NanoChat - $100 - Lambda. 

 - Experimentation with role-play in pedagogy. example: Socratic dialogue - prompting, OpenAI learning model. Heavy customization: system prompts / RAG / fine-turning / hyperparameter tweaking / private data sets / hybrid - multiple model interaction / continuous learning /  long-running tasks - dashboards
 - Space for hosting apps.
 

 - Hosting / RAG / Fine-tuning: how can different AI be wired? 
 - Tech infrastructure - hosting, compute time, resources for customization - low-cost piloting, evaluation tools (weights and biases)
 - Mac 512GB - local hosting

 - Comment: big tech is losing money. How to sustain compute expenditure. Hard to compete with a business model of losing money...
