# Week 1 Summary: Machine Learning and Human Learning — Toward Synthesis

## What we covered
- Framed the course around “synthesis”: humans and machines now learn in reciprocal ways; generative AI learns from us, and we learn differently with it. Asking ChatGPT is not the same as using a calculator or a search engine.
- Positioned Hegel as our guiding lens for the semester, using his ideas to think beyond 18th‑century empiricism (learning as mere accumulation) toward a dialectical model of learning (negation, development, and synthesis).
- Introduced complementary concepts we’ll revisit: technosymbiosis, symbiotic pedagogy, socio‑technical/cyber‑social systems, and recognition.
- Set a tone of productive contradiction: hold AI’s benefits and harms together before making binary judgments—think both‑and, not either‑or.

## Why Hegel? Five quick reasons
- Learning isn’t just stacking facts; it develops through contradictions and syntheses (a richer model for both human and machine learning).
- Learning is social: self‑consciousness emerges through recognition of others.
- History as collective learning: a way to situate AI, alignment, and “singularity” debates.
- Contemporary relevance: renewed Hegel scholarship (e.g., Brandom) connects to language, norms, and consciousness—key to AI ethics and pedagogy.
- Helps us think contradictions without collapsing them, crucial for assessing AI’s mixed effects.

## Course organization (8 weeks)
- Week 1: Synthesis (overview).
- Week 2: Experience (Hegel vs. empiricism; implications for machine “experience”).
- Week 3: Attention (from transformers to human focus and the attention economy).
- Week 4: Recognition (Hegel/Vygotsky; can machines “recognize” us?).
- Week 5: Consciousness (self/other/un/non‑conscious; can machines be conscious?).
- Week 6: Alignment (RLHF, norms, and reciprocal human–machine alignment).
- Week 7: Critique (Kantian frames; Critical AI; when alignment fails).
- Week 8: Synthesis revisited—Technosymbiosis (Hayles; integrating prior themes).

## Administration and assessment
- Weekly seminars: preferred 90 minutes (6:00–7:30) with a short break; may adjust to 60–90 minutes based on feedback.
- Assessment via CGScholar:
- Weeks 2–8 discussion/commentary (70%). Use ML tools visibly—e.g., include edited dialogue with an AI plus your reflective summary.
- Final project (30%): choose one—(a) materials for machines about human culture; (b) materials for humans about machine “experience”; (c) a hybrid guide for cyber‑social learning.

## Tools and practice
- Demonstrated “Hegel Pedagogy AI” (a note‑to‑presentation tool built via prompt engineering).
- Encouraged low‑barrier “vibe coding”: designing and communicating with AI to co‑produce useful tools.

## Looking ahead to Week 2
- Topic: Experience. We’ll contrast Hegel’s account with empiricism (e.g., Locke) and examine what counts as “experience” for today’s ML systems. Bring examples or questions that highlight how machines process, store, and transform experience.

Note: Don’t be put off by the vocabulary—we’ll step through it together, with AI’s help.
