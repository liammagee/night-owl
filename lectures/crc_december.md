proposed project’s strengths and possibilities


a highlight of the proposal is the partnership with Rantoul City School District, and the follow-up potential impacts. 

The intensive and sustained nature of the research is likely to be important to understand fundamental drivers behind multilingual teacher shortage - the problem the project aims to address. It is consistent with the propsal's focus on place-based research, which understands teacher motivation in part through the lens of local community ties and connections. RCS also has a disproportionate high (30%) population of "English Learners", and understanding motivation in this context is likely helpful to address similar issues throughout Illinois and the US - that is, another strength is the applicability of findings in other contexts.

Finally, the research method, of five dialogo-based focus groups and 16 interviews, is appropriate to the questions and focus of the study. The interactive and repeated nature of the focus group discussions also enable deeper investigation than single point-in-time focus groups – trust for example can develop over time, and seasonal and other time-based effects can be documented. There also seem to be reasonable prospects for both publications and further funding.

 - proposed project goals, features, and activities.

This project is developed around the idea of "Justice-oriented Computing" education, which aims to teach computing with cognizance of its wider effects on society. What roles does algorithmic discrimination and bias play in, for example, credit scores, criminal sentencing, surveillance, or university admissions? These questions become even more important with the rise of AI. They are challenging to address however, and this project proposes to build teacher capacity for "Justice-oriented Computing" education in Illinois rural high schools. It employs interviews and observations to understand (a) how early career teachers develop orientations toward "Justice-oriented Computing" and (b) do these orientations contribute to longer-term professional identity formation? The proposed project will use an established computing program, Exploring Computer Science, with just two teachers, but in an intensive way, over two summer programs and the intervening year. There is some phasing to the interviews: the first summer sessions will focus on the first question about orientation, while observations and further interviews over the next year and following summer will address the second question, on identity. The two teachers will be encouraged to be co-researchers - appropriate in this context – and could help to scale the project, if follow-up funding is found.
