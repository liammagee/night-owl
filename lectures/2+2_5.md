# 2+2=5

Whole is the greater than the sum of all parts.

Imagine "plus" as an operation that produces a whole "answer" that includes the answer itself. What would this be? The parts added up, plus one more: the answer as a further "plus one". Now this modified plus, or "plus one", could be designated by "+1" rather than just "+", and
used to produce the following result:

	2 + 2 = 5

Could this plus one be considered just an *interpretation* of the usual plus? In that case 5 would be just as valid an answer as 4 – depending upon our interpretation.
