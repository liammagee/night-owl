### <a id="synthesis"></a>Synthesis

- Technological tools have historically reshaped how we externalize and internalize memory, making machines central to human learning.
- Generative AI now learns from human data and in turn changes the way we learn, creating a reciprocal “learning loop.”
- This new relationship can be framed through concepts such as socio‑technical systems, cyborgism, technosymbiosis, and symbiotic pedagogy.
- The course will explore these dynamics, focusing on how synthesis brings together machine and human learning in the present moment.

```notes
We have entered an era in which our ideas about learning are changing, and perhaps have already changed fundamentally. The history of technological aids, from the writing stylus to the abacus, calculator, Internet and smartphone, has always shaped how we exteriorize our memory, and in turn re-interiorize during recollection. Machines have, in other words, always been central to how we humans learn. 

But today we also talk about machines learning how to do things themselves. Most obviously this happens in the fields of AI, and more specifically, of Generative AI. These machines now learn from *us* – from the traces of us we leave in data stored on the Internet. Machines learn from us; and from these new machines, we also learn differently. Asking ChatGPT to create a new recipe is different, we could say, from asking a calculator to add two numbers or even asking Google to find a recipe. We will explore this difference in the course, but for now we can note that we have entered a period in which "learning" comes to be applied to machines as well as humans, and that this learning, in both cases, depends upon the other.

We can now speak in various ways about this much closer relationship we share with machines. We can speak of socio-technical systems; of cyborgian creatures (Harraway); of cyber-social systems (Kalantzis Cope); and of compound terms like 'technosymbiosis' (Katherine Hayles) or a term I'll be using, in the context of learning, 'symbiotic pedagogy'. But the wider concept we'll be working with this week - and returning to, as we'll see - is that of *synthesis*. *Synthesis* will describe how both the similarities and differences between machine and human learning come together in our present moment.

Through the course we will be studying this relationship in a number of ways. Later I'll talk through the organization of the course materials.

### <a id="weekly-seminars"></a>Weekly seminars.


- Preferred session duration is two hours (5:30‑7:30) with a brief break, including two 15‑minute lecture pods followed by discussion and AI practice.
- Flexibility exists; the actual course schedule may be shorter due to overall time constraints.
- Options under consideration are trimming sessions to 90 minutes or even 60 minutes, pending participant feedback.
- The goal is to balance depth of content with practical engagement within the limited weekly allocation.

```notes
My preference is for these to be two hours (5:30 - 7:30), with a brief break. I'm flexible here though. Essentially we have a lot we can present, discuss and practice. My ideal here is that I will present 2 x 15 minute lecture pods, after which we will have a mix of discussion and practice with AI models.

But the course hours are much fewer than this. What do people think? Otherwise we can truncate to 90 or even 60 minutes.

### <a id="assessment"></a>Assessment

The course will use CGScholar – a platform I think most of you will be familiar with? Assessments will be divided between:

1. Weekly discussion and commentary in CGScholar (formative learning!)
2. An individual curriculum, learning guide or conference presentation outline (summative learning!). This will be your choice, but could be either of:
  a. Learning materials designed for machines, describing some facet of human culture
  b. or Learning materials designed for humans, describing some facet of machine "experience"

### <a id="previous-course"></a>Previous course

A previous version of this course ran in 2023 and 2024: [[2023-Course]]

Despite this having the same name as that course, it is very different. And I would encourage people to look back to Bill and Mary's earlier course, and especially their videos, which are excellent. As you will probably gather, I have a quite different take. I would say by going back and forth, you might get the best of both worlds. Keep the link to the course handy, and feel free to consult both videos and readings.

### <a id="our-approach-in-2025"></a>Our Approach in 2025



---

### Leveraging Hegel for a Contemporary Machine‑Learning Curriculum

- The course uniquely grounds ML concepts in Hegel’s dialectical framework, offering a philosophical lens rarely applied to technology.
- It argues that Hegel’s ideas on synthesis, consciousness, and recognition illuminate the reciprocal learning loop between humans and machines.
- By invoking an early 19th‑century thinker, the approach emphasizes foundational, timeless questions about knowledge, memory, and value alignment in AI.
- The methodology promises to bridge historical philosophical insights with cutting‑edge ML practices, fostering a deeper critical understanding of AI’s societal impact.

```notes
So what distinguishes our approach in 2025? The first and biggest difference will be my reliance on the work of a early 19th century German Philosopher, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. 

Why Hegel? Why build a course on machine learning around a thinker who pre-dates, not only the recent era of machine learning, but the entire history of computation altogether?

Let me give a few reasons.
```

---

## **Hegelian Critique of Empiricist Machine‑Learning Paradigms**

- Current ML models inherit an 18th‑century empiricism that treats learning as mere fact accumulation on a blank slate.
- Hegel challenges this view by framing experience dialectically—new insights can negate or transform prior ones.
- Learning unfolds through developmental stages, each marked by a “learning moment” that may contradict earlier knowledge yet remains integrated via synthesis.
- This dialectical progression anticipates later stage‑based theories (e.g., Piaget), offering a richer model for both human and machine learning cycles.

```notes
First, I will be arguing one of the present limitations of machine learning is that it is stuck in a period of thinking about learning: the 18th century. According to the philosophy of the period – and I am of course simplifying here – the human mind was a blank slate that needed to be filled up with facts. Learning was a comparatively simple process of *accumulation*. Just as life itself is the experience of a sequence of moments, each of which is compared to other moments, so learning is the acquisition of experience that are recorded in the mind. 

This, as we'll review, is a form of the *empiricism* that underpins our current paradigm of machine learning. Now Hegel – as we'll also see – represents a profound challenge to the empirical tradition. His account of experience is not simply accumulative –– it is *dialectical*, which presumes that new experiences can sometimes *negate* those that they succeed. Learning proceeds, in other words, in a series of developmental stages, each of which involves some kind of realization or learning moment which can sometimes refute a past moment. Although, at least in Hegel's account, both past and present moment, even if they stand in contradiction, can be reconciled in a process of *synthesis*, constituting in turn a future moment which initiates the whole process all over again. Some of you might hear echoes here of later theorists of learning like Jean Piaget, who also supposed learning proceeded in development stages.
```

## Hegel’s Social‑Consciousness Lens on Learning

- Hegel argues that learning is fundamentally shaped by interactions with others, not merely individual experience.
- The developmental shift from consciousness to self‑consciousness hinges on recognizing other selves—others who are distinct from the self.
- This social mediation implies that human learning is conditioned and amplified through relational awareness.
- Whether machines can be truly “social” in Hegel’s sense remains unresolved, highlighting a key difference between human and machine learning.

```notes
In addition – and here is the second reason – Hegel's account is rooted in our experience of *others*. In a way that prempts another learning theorist, Vygotsky, Hegel's account of human experience also involves a specific development from consciousness to self-consciousness. Ironically, our awareness of ourselves is closely connected to our awareness of other selves who are not our self - other people, in other words. This awareness means our experience and learning is *social*, conditioned and mediated by others. Now it is an open question as to whether machines are said to be social at all, but certainly not, as we'll see, in the sense that Hegel means. 
```

## Hegel, History, and the AI‑Driven Future

- Hegel views history as a collective learning project progressing toward an ultimate realization—his “Absolute Idea” or Absolute Knowledge.
- Unlike many contemporary thinkers, Hegel insists that history follows a determinate, directional path shaped by social development.
- The rise of AI forces us to question this historical trajectory: Will we reach a singularity, and what new competencies will learners need?
- Though Hegel didn’t predict AI, his engagement with events like the French Revolution invites us to interpret our present within a broader, evolving historical context.

```notes
The third reason relates less to Hegel's direct views about learning, and more to his understanding of history. Within the Western tradition of philosophy, Hegel is the first and central philosopher of history – in the sense that he discusses history as something like a wider social and collective learning project. History moreover has a tendency or direction: it moves towards gradual realization or recognition, what Hegel terms, grandiosely, as the Absolute Idea or Absolute Knowledge. Outside religion, perhaps few today would agree strongly with Hegel that history follows a determinate path. However, with the arrival of AI – and certainly with much of the hype that comes with it – we are also forced to confront a series of questions: where are we going with AI? Will we arrive at a singularity, when AI becomes smarter than humans? And what skills do future human learners need to navigate this particular historical moment? Hegel doesn't answer this question, but – especially in his confrontation with the major events of his own time, including the French Revolution – he is already opening a way for consideration of our position within a wider time and history. 
```

## ** Hegel’s Reemergence in Contemporary AI & Language Debates

- Hegel once seen as obscure is now central to debates on language, norms, and consciousness.
- Recent scholarship (e.g., Brandom’s *A Spirit of Trust*) reinterprets Hegel for modern philosophical inquiry.
- These reinterpretations provide a rich backdrop for discussing AI’s impact on learning and language.
- The text underscores how historical philosophy can inform contemporary AI ethics and pedagogy.

```notes
And finally, Hegel occupies an unusual position himself in the recent history of philosophy. Long regarded – for reasons we shall see, as we begin to look at some of his text – as an obscure and complex thinker without much value to mainstream philosophy, he has become central in recent decades to debates about language, norms and consciousness. Robert Brandom, a prominent American philosopher, has written for example an 800 page volume called *A Spirit of Trust: A Reading of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit*. Brandom, among others, is an important thinker in his own right about AI, and this suggests Hegel provides us with good background – if we want it – to contemporary discussions about learning and language.

## <a id="organization-of-the-course"></a>Organization of the Course


The course is structured over eight weeks, and each week introduces and discusses a new concept. 

---

### **Week‑1 Overview & Upcoming Focus on Hegelian Experience**

- Introductory session establishes “Synthesis” as the course’s foundational theme.
- Next week centers on Hegel’s concept of *Experience* from the Phenomenology of Spirit, framing it as a critique of non‑human learning.
- Comparative analysis will juxtapose Hegelian experience with Locke’s empiricism and contemporary notions of machine “experience.”
- The discussion links experience to broader cognitive dimensions: learning, consciousness, perception, and memory.

```notes
1. **Synthesis** This is the introduction and overview we are doing today. 
 
```

---

### Experience

- Focus on Hegel’s *Experience* as the cornerstone critiquing non‑human learning.
- Contrast Hegelian experience with Locke’s empiricism to illuminate differences between human and machinic “experience.”
- Explore how experience connects to broader cognitive faculties: learning, consciousness, perception, and memory.
- Position this discussion within the course’s theme of synthesis—melding machine and human learning dynamics.

```notes
2. Experience
 - Next week we'll be looking at the concept of Experience. This is a crucial idea in Hegel's **Phenomenology of Spirit**, and constitutes the single largest implicit criticism of non-human learning. We will examine how Hegel unpacks this idea, and contrast it with other ideas of experience (e.g. Locke) that might be closer to what we see of machinic "experience". We will also discuss the relationship of experience to learning, consciousness, perception and memory.
```


---

## **Attention Across Disciplines**

- Integrates neuroscience, psychology, CS, philosophy, and media studies.
- Highlights the seminal paper *Attention is All You Need* as a pivot in machine learning.
- Connects computational attention mechanisms to human learning processes.
- Examines critiques of the “Attention Economy” within critical media theory.

```notes
Attention
  - Following that, we will focus on the idea of attention. This is an idea that spans neuroscience, psychology, computer science, philosophy and media studies. We'll examine a key text in the development of machine learning, "Attention is All you Need". But we will also think about how attention is important for human learning. And we will look at recent critical studies of attention and what has become known as the Attention Economy.

```  

---

### Recognition as a Social Dimension of Learning

- Hegel frames recognition as linking individual learning to relational dynamics with others.
- The week’s discussion juxtaposes Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory with Hegelian insights on intersubjectivity.
- Machines are examined for their potential to "recognize" humans, raising questions about machine–human relationality.
- This exploration situates recognition as a foundational social process underpinning both human and machinic learning.

```notes

4. Recognition  
 - Another key Hegelian idea, this week we will examine how *recognition* connects individual  learning to our relation to others - to, in other words, a social process. We'll discuss here Vygotsky's theory of human learning, and also examine ways machines could be considered as "recognizing" us. 
```

5. Consciousness (Self/Other/Un/Non)
The early parts of Phenomenology of Spirit is dominated by the ideas of Consciousness and Self-consciousness. We'll explore how these relate to Experience, Attention and Recognition (and whether indeed they "synthesize" these earlier ideas). We'll explore also later ideas of the Unconscious (Freud) and Nonconscious Cognition (Katherine Hayles). This leads us naturally to an obvious question: can machines be conscious? If not, can they be unconscious?

## Alignment Between Human Values and Machine Learning

- Alignment refers to aligning AI systems with human values, often via RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback).
- The concept parallels social norms—implied, value‑laden rules that shape behavior rather than explicit laws.
- Alignment is reciprocal: humans also align with others’ norms, and increasingly they align with machine‑generated values in education.
- This dual process highlights the pedagogical potential for AI to both reflect and reshape human learning practices.

```notes
6. Alignment
Alignment is a "vogue" term in machine learning, and describes the process of aligning machines to human values and interests. One technical process for doing this is RLHF – reinforcement learning from human feedback.  This relates closely to ideas of "norms". As opposed to rules or laws, norms describe often implied values that condition our practices, including our speaking practices. So "alignment" also can describe human learning – aligning ourselves with others. And increasingly today, we can also think of humans aligning themselves with machine values, especially in pedagogical settings.  
```


---

## ** Critique as the Hegelian Counterbalance to Alignment

- Critique examines failures of alignment when technology misses societal standards.
- It draws on Kantian categories—rational, practical, aesthetic—to frame how critique operates philosophically.
- The section explores Critical AI’s response to AI, positioning critique as both a tool and product of the very systems it scrutinizes.
- Overall, critique serves as the dialectical counterpart that ensures alignment remains reflexive and socially grounded.

```notes
7. Critique 
"Critique" then brings us to what happens when alignment, one way or another, fails: when technology, in other words, fails to meet the wider social standards we set for it. Critique is another keyword also in the Hegelian nomenclature - it comes famously from Kant, for whom "Critique" is the method for understanding how "pure" (rational, scientific), "practical" (applied, moral) and "judgemental" (aesthetic) reasoning can happen. Here we will look at how Critical AI has been responding to AI - and look in turn at how AI works itself as a tool for, as well as of, critique. 
```

## Technosymbiosis as a Hegelian Synthesis

- Revisits synthesis, now enriched by prior concepts (experience, attention, recognition, consciousness).
- Positions Katherine Hayles’ “technosymbiosis” as the fusion of technology and life.
- Frames technosymbiosis as an integrative model that subsumes alignment and critique.
- Emphasizes a dialectical evolution: each new idea reshapes the foundational notion of synthesis.

```notes
8. Synthesis: Technosymbiosis
Finally, we return to where we started: with the concept of synthesis. However – just like a Hegelian process of argument – our original concept is now modified and inflected by the other concepts and materials we've encountered. In particular we are in a position to understand N. Katherine Hayles' idea of "technosymbiosis" – the combining of technology and life – a synthesis that also incorporates earlier ideas of experience, attention, recognition, consciousness, alignment and critique. 
```

## <a id="a-word-on-software"></a>A word on software....


- Introduces “Hegel Pedagogy AI,” a custom note‑to‑presentation converter developed via prompt engineering with Claude.
- Highlights the shift from traditional coding to conversational design—“vibe coding”—emphasizing communication over algorithmic depth.
- Positions AI as a low‑barrier software‑writing assistant that democratizes technical creation for educators and learners.
- Connects this new skill set to broader course themes, framing it as a necessary form of human–machine co‑learning.

```notes
Now some of you may have seen that I'm using some unusual software to do this presentation – and I'll be using it for the rest of this course. You'll see it's called "Hegel Pedagogy AI", and indeed I've written this software – or more exactly, I've prompted Claude to write the software. I used to be a software developer, and I've always wanted something that could convert notes into a presentation. So I asked Claude to write this "note converter" for this course. It may change week-to-week, and if I think it is useful for anyone other than myself, I'll release it.


But more to the point, I want people also to experiment with how these AI tools also write software. In fact this might be one of the sweet spots of AI today – as a software writing assistant. For the right applications, it has reduced the technical demands of users to nearly zero. One practical effect is that the key skills needed for so-called "vibe coding" are no longer deep algorithmic knowledge, but rather design and writing – specifically, how to talk to machines to get the results you want. Management, in other words, and not far removed from teaching. A new kind of human human learning is required to make use of these new kinds of learning machines, and to offset some of the conceptual terrain of this course, we'll also be practicing how to write software.
