# 584 Lecture 1


<!--
How do you build a sense of your field and its gaps? This course aims to make sense of a term – academic literature – at once mundane and mystical. It starts with fundamentals: how to build, annotate, analyze, map and translate a literature database into a literature review. It progresses to think about how AI and other technology can help foster more critical, analytic and reflexive modes of interpretation and understandings of the field.

All required material (video lectures, readings etc.) will be provided to students, as per the tentative schedule below
-->


 - Welcome to 584: AI and Academic Literature!
 - Why does this course exist?
   - Literature reviews are complex...
   - AI can simplify...
   - But do we want simplification (congitive offloading, plagiarism)?
 - Can AI make academic more enriching - for writers and readers?

### ChatGPT Features



| Feature | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add photos and files | When you want to add more context | "Analyze these three files for common themes" |
| Add from Google Drive | As above | "Analyze these three files for common themes" |
| Deep Research | When you want to include web search results (and can wait) | "Give me the most recent results of AI use at middle school level" |
| Create image | Generate an image from text | "Create an image of an AI professor"  |
| Agent mode | Like "Deep Research", but uses tools, autonomy | "Act as a research assistant. Find the most recent (2025) peer-reviewed studies on AI in middle school STEM education in the U.S. Summarize their findings, give DOIs, and extract common themes." |
| Add sources | Apply ChatGPT to email, docs, file repositories etc (what about security?) | "Add my email as a source of information" |
| Learn mode | "Prompts" the user - Socratic method |  |
| Web Search | Like "Deep Research" but faster, less "thinking" | "What's the latest news?" |
| Canvas | Interactive Documents | "" |

### Use Python


Just use it!

> Use Python to generate 100 random numbers between 0 and 1 and plot their histogram.

But no interactivity!

---

### How do I generate and run code?

1. Have ChatGPT setup and run code on your local machine. Needs patience, some technical expertise (e.g. terminal / command line)
2. Install Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code - connect to OpenAI's Codex / Claude 
3. Use Claude or Gemini - both ahead in this area
4. Use an online service (Vercel, Replit are examples)
