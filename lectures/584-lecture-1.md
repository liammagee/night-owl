# 584 Lecture 1


<!--
How do you build a sense of your field and its gaps? This course aims to make sense of a term – academic literature – at once mundane and mystical. It starts with fundamentals: how to build, annotate, analyze, map and translate a literature database into a literature review. It progresses to think about how AI and other technology can help foster more critical, analytic and reflexive modes of interpretation and understandings of the field.

All required material (video lectures, readings etc.) will be provided to students, as per the tentative schedule below
