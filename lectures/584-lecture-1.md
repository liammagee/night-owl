# 584 - AI and Academic Literature

---

How do you build a sense of your field and its gaps? This course aims to make sense of a term – academic literature – at once mundane and mystical. It starts with fundamentals: how to build, annotate, analyze, map and translate a literature database into a literature review. It progresses to think about how AI and other technology can help foster more critical, analytic and reflexive modes of interpretation and understandings of the field.

All required material (video lectures, readings etc.) will be provided to students, as per the tentative schedule below

### Assessments: Building a 'Mock' (or Real) Literature Review

The aim of the course is to build a cumulative literature review. It is a course in which to experiment with different approaches to engage with literature. Accordingly assessment will focus less on the "correctness" of the final output and more on week-to-week engagement with course materials and activities. 

That all said, the purpose of the course is to support a dissertation / journal article / other academic writing – to that extent, if the final output does serve other purposes, well and good!

 - First Draft of Research Topic / Research Question
