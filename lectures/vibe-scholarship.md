## Vibe Scholarship

 - Let's write an article: "Vibe Scholarship: A New Path to Knowledge or the Latest AI Snake-Oil?" Co-authored by all of us and ChatGPT


---

## What is Vibe Scholarship?

 - Quick and dirty structure, writing, citations, data generation, data analysis
 - **NOT**: "Write me an essay on..."
 - Something our "proper" scholarship can learn from
 - Removes fear of academic writing? 


---

## Where to start?

 - ChatGPT, Zoom, Google Docs
 - Literature search...
   - What's the gap?


--- 

## Frame an introduction....

- Let's sketch some background, a research question, an overview of our structure...


---

## What methods are appropriate?

- Let's discuss choice of methods, perhaps some references on relevant methods, the need for IRB approval, a theoretical position, a statement about the researcher...
  - Our approach to data analysis (statistics, thematic analysis etc)
  - For argument's sake, let's use mixed methods


---

## What about data?

 - Can we generate synthetic data that we can use to test our data analysis approach?

---

### Synthetic data analysis

 - What does the "synthetic" data say? What patterns does it show?

---

### Answering Our Question

 - Mock-up a Conclusion: what is the answer to our question? What does this answer mean? What further research is needed?

---

### Polish

 - Generate the references
 - Help out with Abstract, Keywords, Title (still the right title?)

---

### Proof & Critique

- Do your worst AI - be the "2nd reviewer"
- Does the structure work?
- Is the argument coherent? valid?

---

### Reflections

- What is our **actual** answer to this question?
