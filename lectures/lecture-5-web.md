## Consciousness

This week we return to Hegelian territory with the topic of Consciousness. But our aim will not be to unpack further sections of *The Phenomenology of Spirit*. Instead we will want to see how Hegel's insights marry up with other conceptions of human consciousness, and how these in turn might relate to the prospect of human consciousness.

We'll start by looking at three influential accounts:





Hayles, N. K. (2015). Nonconscious Cognition and Jess Stoner’s I Have Blinded Myself Writing This’. Torque, 2.

Freud, S. (1922). The Unconscious. The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 56(3), 291-294.
