2. Weekly Format

4. Lens: Hegelian Philosophy. Why Hegel?
 - basic hypothesis: machine learning is rooted in 18th century empiricism (more data = more truth)
 - What does Hegel offer? One way to think about learning as *nonlinear* (structured / dialectical / involving negation etc)
 - This will hopefully become clear! We start with the idea of synthesis between machine learning and human learning, then go down several rabbit holes, before returning, in Week 8, to a modified idea of synthesis.
