## Hegel's Revenge: The Return of the *Grand Récit*


Perhaps the major intellectual movement in the postwar period, postmodernist (and related poststructuralist) thought argued against what one prominent theorist, Jean Francois Lyotard, termed the *Grand Récit*: the idea of the grand narrative. For Lyotard, and for many others, grand narratives died with the second world war, because no major project for humanity could any longer be sustained. Instead, we would be faced with competing *small narratives*, reflecting the desires of communities and perhaps nations, but not of humanity as a whole. In intellectual terms, we may have specific disciplinary projects and agendas, but not a grand unifying theory capable of tying, for instance, the sciences and the humanities together. Knowledge was to be fractured, partial, no longer held together by any organization or structure (hence "poststructural"). 

This argument was directed towards the major proponents of "big picture" thinking: Sartre, Freud, Marx among them. But perhaps the largest target was Hegel, who more than any other projected a "big picture" and grand narrative: knowledge able to move beyond its disciplinary and temporary constraints, and so to become "Absolute". 

Do we hear echoes of Hegel today? Certainly those promoting AI do so partly on grounds that the limits of knowledge might be overcome. Maths and science can be accelerated. Texts and media in different languages can be translated. Differences in perspectives can be explained. Last week I suggested - perhaps a little tongue-in-cheek - that Hegel was a transhumanist. But does AI now promise a return to the possibilities that Hegel, along with other Enlightenment thinkers, demarcated? 

To round out our course on machine and human learning, we examine the last (as well as the first) of our concepts: *Synthesis*. We explore how machines and humans, in varied ways, might be or become synthesized, and consider what this means for the stories we tell about our futures. 

Last week we saw how critical AI – a discipline originating within the humanities – emphasized its negative effects. But critical scholarship can also point the way forward. This week's readings – from Rosa Braidoti, N Katherine Hayles, Yuk Hui, and Kalantzis and Cope – emphasize alternative visions for how AI might help us to construct posthuman, technosymbiotic, technodiverse and cybersocial feedback loops that promote collective human as much as machine learning. If these paths do not tend toward Absolute Knowledge, then perhaps they also avoid yoking learning to the demands of servitude.

Our final step for the course will be to compile a curriculum and syllabus. We will spend some time in class transferring this theoretical discussion into the practical work of the final assignment.
