## Attention



The past two weeks we wrestled with Hegel's discussion of concepts of Experience and Recognition. This week we change pace – and century – to look at a concept that has more direct relevance to both machine and human learning: the concept of attention.

In particular we look at the three papers which discuss attention in different ways.

The first, "The Attention System of the Human Brain" (Petersen & Posner, 2012), revisits their 1989 paper of the same name. This initial paper has had a significant influence on neuroscience, psychology and by extension pedagogy, laying foundations for understanding the diverse neural contributors to attention, and hence, also to learning.

The second, "Attention is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017) is even more significant, as it introduces the foundational Transformer-based architecture that sits behind mauch of what today is termed AI. 

Both papers are significant. Yet Vaswani et al.'s use of "attention" correlates only loosely with Posner and Petersen's term. Is "attention" the key concept that underpins both machine and human learning, or simply a metaphor – like "neural" itself – used to describe an analogous process in machines?

In this week's third paper, we look at attention from yet another lens. "The attention economy" is a more critical use of the term, describing how firms seeks to profiteer from human engagement with (primarily) social media platforms. Here we might see more commonality with Hegel's ideas, and especially with his analysis of the master/servant dialectic. Are we masters of our own attention on these platforms – free to switch off whenever we chooose? Or are we servants, addicated to the relentless engagement farming that both platforms and content providers engage in? Does our experience of the apparent intimacy conveyed by social media – direct address, personalization, and so on – involve genuine recognition? Or just the appearance of it? Terranova's paper, though from 13 years ago, was already building upon neuroscience research to pose these questions in the formative years of social media.

Finally, though we won't discuss it in class, 
for those seeking some further references on the attention economy: Hansen's recent (2024) article is a useful pivot on the concept in light of AI. For Hansen, the subscription-based model of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and other services is aimed less at profiting from the sale of advertising and more at building a cognitive dependency on a a given platform.

### This Week's Questions

Feel free to response to any or all of the following for this week:

 - What is "attention"? It is a common mechanism that unites what humans and machines do when they learn? Or - as we suggest above – is this just a convenient term copied from one discipline to another?
 
 - Does AI mark a shift from the attention economy (where, to quote a common saying, if the product is free then the real product is *you*), marked by search engines and social media? Or is it the case that attention has simply shifted, to a more sustained and focussed engagement with the chatbot in front of me? 
 
 - From what we learn about attention this week – and thinking ahead to the end-of-semester activity – how do we design machines to better address the challenges of human attention (attracting it, sustaining it, eventually easing it off as a subject is mastered)? And where might we need to go if we want to simulate higher-order attention in machines – attention to us for example? Can Hegelian recognition play a role – in both human and machine learning – in developing and maintaining attention?
