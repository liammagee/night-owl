### ChatGPT Features



| Feature | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add photos and files | When you want to add more context | "Analyze these three files for common themes" |
| Add from Google Drive | As above | "Analyze these three files for common themes" |
| Deep Research | When you want to include web search results (and can wait) | "Give me the most recent results of AI use at middle school level" |
| Create image | Generate an image from text | "Create an image of an AI professor"  |
| Agent mode | Like "Deep Research", but uses tools, autonomy | "Act as a research assistant. Find the most recent (2025) peer-reviewed studies on AI in middle school STEM education in the U.S. Summarize their findings, give DOIs, and extract common themes." |
| Add sources | Apply ChatGPT to email, docs, file repositories etc (what about security?) | "Add my email as a source of information" |
| Learn mode | "Prompts" the user - Socratic method |  |
| Web Search | Like "Deep Research" but faster, less "thinking" | "What's the latest news?" |
| Canvas | Interactive Documents | "" |

### Use Python


Just use it!

> Use Python to generate 100 random numbers between 0 and 1 and plot their histogram.

But no interactivity!

---

### How do I generate and run code?

1. Have ChatGPT setup and run code on your local machine. Needs patience, some technical expertise (e.g. terminal / command line)
2. Install Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code - connect to OpenAI's Codex / Claude 
3. Use Claude or Gemini - both ahead in this area
4. Use an online service (Vercel, Replit are examples)
