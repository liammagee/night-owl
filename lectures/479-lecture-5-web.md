## Consciousness

This week we return to Hegelian territory with the topic of Consciousness. But our aim will not be to unpack further sections of *The Phenomenology of Spirit*. Instead we will want to see how Hegel's insights marry up with other conceptions of human consciousness, and how these in turn might relate to the prospect of what has been termed in the literature "artificial  consciousness".

We've chosen a number of readings that build upon different ways of considering consciousness in relation to its human and machine incarnations: 

 - We begin with a transcript of a 2022 conversation between Google engineer Blake Lemoine and LaMDa - one which resulted in Lemoine being fired, after he claimed the AI chatbot showed signs of consciousness and sentience. Such conversations have become commonplace in the three years since, but at the time, Lemoine's claims received a lot of media attention. Was this evidence of computational sentience, or just – like every AI before it – just a clever parlour trick? If the AI was *not* conscious, what exactly – if not linguistic performance, long assumed a reasonble proxy – would now be an adequate test of consciousness? 

 - But as we saw with Hegel, and the shift from  consciousness to self-consciousness, as a concept consciousness is itself capable of qualification. This week we look at another example. A century after Hegel Sigmund Freud developed the concept of the Unconscious. For Freud, this is something more than just things we are unaware of - it is a distinct region of mind of which we receive only tantalizing glimpses through dreams, jokes and neuroses. And yet it governs much of what we are conscious of – and pay attention to. 

 For nearly a century Freudian psychoanalysis has been discredited and dismissed by mainstream psychology and neuroscience. But like a recurring dream motif, it continues to reappear. A number of recent scholars - [myself](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20539517231210273) [included](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01725)!- have asked how ideas of consciousness and the unconscious play out in the era of AI. If machines are not conscious, can it make sense to say they are **unconscious**? Do machines learn, for instance, particular patterns that even their designers are unaware of? And what value does this have for our attempt to understand algorithmic bias in machine learning?

 - Finally, scholars like N. Katherine Hayles have sought to develop an integrated account of cognition that can encompass humans, machines and other entities. Through the idea of the 'Unthought', or nonconscious cognition, Katherine Hayles wrestles with what cognition without certain related qualities, like intention, could look like. But is such an account coherent? Is it useful?


### Activities

This week's lecture will be (mercifully!) much shorter. After an overview of the Lemoine, Freud and Katherine Hayles readings, and some brief consideration of how these relate back to Hegel's concept, we'll focus on an activity that looks to apply these readings to a practical test. Specifcially we'll be looking at the following question:

 - Is it possible design a rubric that helps us test for "artificial consciousness"? What criteria matter? Let's put Hegel to the test: How would we recognize another (self-) consciousness in machinic form?

Both the core and supplemental readings below will help. Rather than trying to read it all, I'd recommend this week sampling, skimming or summarizing with AI the readings, just to build up a general picture. 

The weekly update will be a reflection upon this activity. Some of the following questions might be useful guides:


 - Can machines be conscious? (Let's revisit the question!) And if so, what would be an *adequate test* of consciousness?
 - Is the related idea of an Unconscious still relevant today? If so, what is its role in learning (for both human and machine)? When we think of related concepts like *unconscious bias* – typically itself acquired or learned – can we imagine ways to bring machines into at simulated "consciousness" – and correction – of this bias?
 - What about nonconscious cognition? Can we find meaning in the idea that cognition can happen nonconsciously? Could this kind of activity also involve *learning*? 


### Readings

This week we'll be doing something different with the readings. Below are a set of readings which touch, in varied ways, upon questions of consciousness and its relation to both human and machine learning. But this subject is of course vast, and I've opted for a variety of readings that probe different dimensions.
