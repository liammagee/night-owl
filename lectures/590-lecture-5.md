  - Conceptual Discussion: "What Do I Know?" Towards A Sociology of Knowledge 
  - Framing Language: "Carry" Your Reader 
  - Frame up your Literature Review

### Common Pitfalls of Literature Reviews

1. Length - some reviews extend to 15k, 25k, 30k words. This is too long!
2. Conversely, no signposting - straight into "X said this, Y said that"
   - Issue of the "so what" question. Why does the reader care, or need to know this?
   - Having sympathy for the reader / reviewer / examiner...
3. "Gap" not justified by the preceding review. The review must read like a (legal?) dossier of **evidence** about the claim of gaps
   - Styles may differ (e.g. Spivak (1988) and Zhang et al. (2025))



---

### We'll continue to focus on...

1. **Concise** writing (AI as concise writer – from prose to (prosaic) poetry)
2. **Structure** and **metadiscourse** - guide your reader through the evidence (AI as roleplay - lawyer?)
3. **Evidence-based** argument: gaps must be discovered (AI as lawyer)



---

### If it helps...

 - A literature review concludes with an **argument** for existence of gaps
 - This argument must be **proved**: corroborated by the evidence supplied in the review
 - This is hard to do and difficult to learn!



---

### Structuring Your Literature Review

Pick a **principle**:
 - General > Specific – can confirm but also **contrast** ("General theories of pedagogy suggest... *However* studies of adult language learners also show...")
 - Chronological ("By the 1960s, discussions of AI had already become more muted...")
 - Thematic ("The concept of 'attention' is used in roughly similar ways in machine and human learning...")
 - Spatial ("Studies in Asian universities show that ...; in contrast, findings from North American universities suggest...")
 - Developmental ("First I will present an outline of the mind/body problem. I then move on to look at critiques of the very distinction itself...")
 - Other models? 
 - Nested Categories (chronology then thematic, etc)?


---

### Some Guiding Notes

 - *Specialization*: Can work well when you want to convey a sense of **narrowing** down a focus: Education > K12 > Math learning > Algebra > in rural Mid-west schools
 - *Chronological*: Can work well when you want to convey a sense of **progress**
   - And how your work **extends** that progress
 - *Thematic*: Can work well when you want to convey a sense of **overlaps**, **intersection** and **gaps**
   - And how your work discovers and fills one of these gaps



---

### Some Guiding Notes (2)

 - *Spatial*: Works well when you want to convey a sense of cultural, spatial or geographic difference
   - And how your study attends to a location or zone not previously studied
 - *Developmental*: Works well when you plan to build your argument through a sequence of positions / thinkers / ideas
   - And show how you will blend, contrast or critique all of these positions / thinkers / ideas 



---

### Nested categories

 - 3 themes - each with their own history
 - Or: General > Special - special might involve *chronological* and *spatial* differences. "General pedagogy theories developed in the early/mid-twentieth century of pedagogy suggest... More recent studies suggest national and local cultures play a greater role. For instance, Indian scholars of K12 learning have shown..."
 


---

### How do I Decide?

 - Often iterative:
   - Go **forward** to discover the gap
   - Move **back** from the gap to discover the structure
 - Experiment with different structures
   - Mock up your structure (more on this soon)
   
---

### Metadiscourse / Signposting 

 - Assume your reader does **not know** the literature
 - A literature review is often **pedagogical** - teaching the reader about a field, in order to persuade them about the gap your research fills
 - Helps **you** in authoring - does Y really follow from X?
 - Be prepared to write / re-write this metadiscursive text often - especially early, as you experiment with structural principles (chronological etc)


---

### Making It Explicit

 - Cannot be too explicit about your structure:
   - Introduction (future tense): 
     - "In this literature review I will..."
     - (or if you prefer) "This review will..."
   - Conclusion (past tense): 
     - "In this review, I have discussed literature relating to..."
     - (or if you prefer) "This review has..."
   - Along the way:
     - "In the last section, I discussed.... In the next, I will..."
     - Can be blended through connective language. "While the *preceding studies* illustrated how use of AI in education has been studied extensively, less has been said about how AI contributes to the student/teacher relationship. Some exceptions include studies by X, Y and Z..."

---

### Develop a Repertoire of Metadiscourse

 - Ask AI for suggestions...
   - "Give me examples of metadiscourse for a literature review"
   - Or "Give me a table and distinguish between metadiscourse used in (a) scientific and (b) humanities discussions of literature"


---


### Play as "Metadiscourse Detective"

1. Go to: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1rKenX37bOW6E6u8xri1H1giuVqvoNi45
2. Play "Identify Metadiscourse".
3. "Change Mode", then play "Add Metadiscourse" 




---


### Group work: Make Your Own Literature Review Game

1. Discuss and develop one key challenge with developing a literature review. Could relate to structuring, metadiscourse / signposting, or anything else.
2. Go to: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1rKenX37bOW6E6u8xri1H1giuVqvoNi45
3. Write a prompt that builds a game or app that helps practice or address the key challenge.
4. Test and iterate!
5. Share and write-up results...

### Sociology of Knowledge

 - Study of academic / scholarly societies
 - Navel gazing? Perhaps. But relevant for all academia because it helps us calibrate our writing (tone / citations )
 - We've already touched on this
   - Two Cultures (Snow) – Humanities and the Sciences)
 - But also: what are **financial** / **political** drivers of research? What are the conceptual or ideological **frames**? What are the standards for **evidence** or **truth**? Compare Spivak (1988) to Zhang et al. (2025)
 

---

### Sociology of Knowledge: Key figures

- Karl Marx (19th century): How do *material conditions* influence *thought*?
- Emile Durkheim (1912): *The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*
- Sigmund Freud (1930): *Civilization and its Discontents*
- Karl Mannheim (1929): *Ideology and Utopia* 
- Thomas Kuhn (1962): *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* 
- Berger, Luckmann (1966): *The Social Construction of Reality*
- Bourdieu (1977): *Outline of a Theory of Practice*
- Michel Foucault (1966, 1969): *The Order of Things*, *The Archaeology of Knowledge*
- David Bloor (1976), *Knowledge and social imagery*
- Bruno Latour, Steve Woolgar (1979), *Laboratory Life* 
- Edward Said (1976), *Orientalism*
- Gayatri Spivak (1987), *In Other Words*
- Judith Butler (1990), *Gender Trouble*
 

---

### Sociology of Knowledge: Common Points?

- Thinking is not independent of **conditions** of life
- What are "conditions"?
  - Class (Marx), race, gender (Said, Butler, Spivak)
  - Social facts - fads & fashions (Durkheim)
  - Ideology - what fundamental beliefs structure or make possible our thinking (Mannheim)
  - Paradigms (Kuhn), epistemes (Foucault), habitus (Bourdieu): background forms of knowing and being
- Related to unconscious bias (Freud) 

---

### Why does this matter?

- Often asked to account for your **positionality**
- Hard to do! What is your *unconscious bias*? What are you *conscious of being unconscious of*?
  - If you knew, it wouldn't be unconscious!
- Irregular verbs:
  - "**I think** critically and independently"
  - "**You think** according to the influences of your economic class and upbringing"
  - "**She / He / They think** as unaware and naive victims of ideology" 


---

### Questions about an academic community:

 - What is its **jargon**? Do you want to reproduce, challenge or modify this jargon?
 - What are its **standards of evidence**? What does it **find persuasive**? What are the **key questions** it is asking? 
 - How stringent are its expectations about **method**, **citation**, **formatting**?
 - What are its markers of **distinction** and **discernment** – "tickets to the game"?
 - Conversely: what seem to be the things **not to say**?

---

### How can you develop this tacit sense? Options:

 - Treat it like a research project - study academics like an community
   - Read journals
   - Attend conferences
   - Observe faculty
   - Join committees
   - Read or scan 'campus' novels & drama
   - Maintain a reflective journal
   - Share your own research, ask for feedback
   - Ask AI to play the role of an academic in a field

### Relationship to Literature Review

 - Write with your audience in mind 
 - But - very important! – not as though you are already "in the club"
 - Take a reference to Spivak. You might know your audience is likely familiar with Spivak's work. But of course you don't say:
   - "*As we all know*, Spivak argued that"
   - Instead it is as though your audience forgot Spivak's point and you gently remind them: "Spivak argued that..."
   - But then you might twist this familiarity: "In the age of AI, it might seem Spivak's arguments regarding grammatization have dated. However,..."
 - So a literature review can translate your own sociological research into some careful phrasing that both *reassures* and *surprises* your community

### Homework! Structuring and scaffolding your review

 - Revisit the recipe from week 3 
 - Prepare 3 variations of the literature you have collected:
   - Chronological
   - Thematic
   - Nested / Blended (can be any combination of options)
 - For each: develop 3-6 headings that shows how you might organize the literature you have collected so far
 - Add this to Week 5
 - Ask AI to do the same thing with your article collection, and write 3-5 sentences evaluating how useful you thought its results were
