# Thoughts On Dissertation Writing


### Writing Session Round Table Feedback



---

### 3 exercises:

1. Concentrate on what you are experiencing right now. Try to gather all of your sensory information: what you see, what you hear. Your bodily impulses; maybe an itch or sense of irration? Think about what thoughts might be circling in the background; thinking ahead to plans to travel, perhaps a mix of anxiety and excitement about face-to-face discussion with scholars. A wider apprehension about the future of education, and your own role within it? Write it down...

2. Now allow your mind to wander back in time, and seize some recollection from the short or longer term past. Maybe the group photo you were in just now. Perhaps your transit here, or a conversation on campus. Or further back: something in a classroom or at home. But in short: a memory. Write it down...

3. Now think back to the last piece of writing you wrote for your dissertation, or course assessment. Try to recall the very last sentence of that writing. Without consulting your phone or laptop, write down as close as possible what you recall you had written previously.

### AI as writing technology

#### Edmund Husserl:

 - Primary retention: what just happened. You don't need to recall it explicitly. No effect is needed; you write / speak as it happens. It is memory, but without effort. Adds to the perception of duration, time.

 - Secondary retention: what happened previously, but is no longer immediately residual in consciousness. But we can retrieve it with some effort. Or sometimes, when we don't make an effort - memories just intrude themselves.

 - Protention: what is just about to come.


#### Bernard Stiegler:

- Tertiary retention: memory *exteriorized*, made durable. Typically (not only) via technology, technical artefacts - everything from writing to AI.


---

### Key Insight: Tertiary retention via technology is not **neutral**. 


- Technologies modify storage and retrieval of memory.
- (See associated history of semiotics, media studies: Roland Barthes, Marshall McLuhan, Friedrich Kittler etc)
- The effects of technologies like the camera, mass media, typewriter, gramaphone on how our "memories" are brought back to us

### The Anxiety of (Technological Influence)

- Harold Bloom: Anxiety of Influence - how one poet influences another
- But what happens when the "poet" is not a person (Shakespeare) but a machine (GPT-5)?

### Plato's Anxieties



> SOCRATES: At the Egyptian city of Naucratis, there was a famous old god, whose name was Theuth; the bird which is called the Ibis is sacred to him, and he was the inventor of many arts, such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice, but his great discovery was the use of letters. Now in those days the god Thamus was the king of the whole country of Egypt; and he dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt which the Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes, and the god himself is called by them Ammon. To him came Theuth and showed his inventions, desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them; he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he approved or disapproved of them. It would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters, This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied: O most ingenious Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them. **And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have; for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves. The specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.**

### Plato's Anxieties

> SOCRATES: I cannot help feeling, Phaedrus, that writing is unfortunately like painting; for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life, and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence. And the same may be said of speeches. You would imagine that they had intelligence, but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them, the speaker always gives one unvarying answer. And when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them, and know not to whom they should reply, to whom not: and, if they are maltreated or abused, they have no parent to protect them; and they cannot protect or defend themselves.

### Stiegler's Anxieties

 - Proletarianization: cognitive offloading, lock-in
 - Attention / Affective Economies
 - Sleeplessness ("always-on" cognitition)
 - Immaterial Labor - exploitation via attention, "playbour", social media, data extraction

### Questions in the era of *Hyper-Writing* (otherwise known as AI)

 - Our anxieties about learning and retention are not new!
 - But a new era of "hyper-writing" - effects not yet understood

### Writing **Strategies** in the Age of AI

 - Mock-up research design
 - Find your voice / practice your style
 - "Just-in-time" research
 - Research rehearsal:
    - how does my survey sound
    - how do my interview questions sound
 - Does my research hang together: **gap** in the literature > research question > method selection > data collection & analysis > answer my question > **fill** the gap in the literature
 - Vibe scholarship?
 - Writing as Discipline: give me rewards! Coffee! Donuts! Praise! Develop your own behaviouralism
