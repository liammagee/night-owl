# Write Up

## Introduction

This article describes the process of developing a lecture writing tool. I wanted to create a tool to help organize disparate ideas in relation to a course on machine and human learning, thought through the lens of Hegel's *Phenomenology of Mind*.



### Features

 - Claude Code-terminal
 - Telescopic text
 - Multiformat output with citations
 - Render to Prezi-style presentation
 - AI support throughout: convert to slide, etc.
 - Visualizations - graphs, circles, part-whole diagrams
 - Gamified writing
 - Vibe lecturing
