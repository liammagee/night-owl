# Image Height Extension Test

This slide contains text content only. It should maintain the default slide height of 486px.

---

# Slide with Small Image

This slide contains a small image that should fit within the default height.

Some additional text below the image.

---

# Slide with Large Image

This slide contains a larger image that should automatically extend the slide height to accommodate the full image without cropping.

![concept-relations](concept-relations.png)

More text content here to demonstrate that the slide expands vertically to show both the image and text content properly.

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

The slide container should automatically extend to show all content including this text at the bottom.

# Normal Text Slide

This slide has no images and should maintain the default 486px height constraint with overflow hidden, just like the first slide.
