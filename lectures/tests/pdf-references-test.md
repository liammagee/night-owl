# PDF Export with References Test

This document tests the new pandoc-based PDF export with full bibliography support.

## Introduction

This test document demonstrates how the new "Export as PDF (with References)" feature processes citations and generates a proper bibliography section. Unlike the basic PDF export, this version uses pandoc for full academic citation support.

## Testing Citations

### Classic Philosophy
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit* [@hegel1807] remains one of the most influential works in German idealism. Contemporary scholars like Charles Taylor [@taylor1975] have provided important interpretations of Hegel's work for modern readers.

### Contemporary Scholarship
Robert Brandom's recent work [@brandom2019] offers a systematic reading of Hegel that connects his ideas to contemporary analytic philosophy. Meanwhile, new research in AI and philosophy [@smith2020] explores how Hegelian concepts apply to artificial intelligence.

### Online Resources
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [@sep2023] provides an excellent overview of Hegel's philosophical system, making his complex ideas more accessible to contemporary readers.

## Mathematical Notation

The dialectical process can be represented mathematically:

$$\text{Thesis} + \text{Antithesis} \rightarrow \text{Synthesis}$$

More complex mathematical expressions:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

## Code Example

The export also supports syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```python
def hegelian_dialectic(thesis, antithesis):
    """
    A simplified representation of the dialectical process
    """
    contradiction = analyze_opposition(thesis, antithesis)
    synthesis = resolve_contradiction(contradiction)
    return synthesis

# Example usage
new_concept = hegelian_dialectic("Being", "Nothing")
print(f"Synthesis: {new_concept}")  # Output: "Becoming"
```
