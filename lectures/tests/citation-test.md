# PDF Association Test

This markdown file is associated with citation-test.pdf (if it exists). When the PDF is opened, this markdown content should appear in the editor.

## Testing PDF-Markdown Association

The system should:
1. Detect when a PDF file is opened
2. Look for a corresponding .md file with the same basename
3. Load the markdown file in the editor
4. Display the PDF in the preview panel

## Sample Content

This demonstrates the intelligent file association feature where PDFs and their corresponding markdown files work together seamlessly.

### Academic Workflow

This feature enables an academic workflow where:
- **PDF files** contain the final formatted documents
- **Markdown files** contain the editable source content
- Both can be managed together in the same directory

### Citations Example

Here's how citations work in the markdown source:

The relationship between Hegelian dialectics and artificial intelligence [@smith2020] remains an active area of research. Hegel's original work [@hegel1807] provides the philosophical foundation, while contemporary scholars [@taylor1975; @brandom2019] have extended these ideas to modern contexts.

## Mathematical Notation

The dialectical process: $\text{Thesis} \rightarrow \text{Antithesis} \rightarrow \text{Synthesis}$

Complex equations:
$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$
