## Attention

As we've noted in the week's online guide, this week we are moving both back and forward - back to the earlier moments of consciousness, perception in particular, but also forward to the much more recent developments in both neuro and computer science.

What I propose this week is that we examine three key papers that all treat the concept of attention in a specific way. I won't be doing too much here to relate this concept to Hegel's unfolding architecture in *Phenomenology of Spirit* - we'll instead turn to that in the weeks ahead. But you may want to think how different meanings of attention might be situated with respect to both concepts of experience and recognition we've covered to date.

I'll start by looking at the Petersen & Posner [@stevene.petersen2012theattention] paper, *The Attention System of the Human Brain: 20 Years After*, then the Vaswani et al's [@ashishvaswani2017attentionis] *Attention is All You Need* paper, and then finally Terranova's [@tizianaterranova2012attentioneconomy] critique of the Attention Economy.
