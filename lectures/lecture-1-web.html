<p>Comment on any of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to learn? How do you know when human learning happens: in the classroom, workplace or life?</li>
<li>Machine learning is clearly inspired by human learning. In your use of AI to date, how would you describe what it has learned (memorized, regurgitated, etc)? When AI gets things wrong, how are its errors different (or similar) to human mistakes?</li>
<li>I have introduced the concept of &quot;synthesis&quot; to describe the similarities and differences between machine and human learning.  What are your views? Do the similarities outweigh the differences, or vice versa?</li>

<li>Lens: Hegelian Philosophy. Why Hegel?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>basic hypothesis: machine learning is rooted in 18th century empiricism (more data = more truth)</li>
<li>What does Hegel offer? One way to think about learning as <em>nonlinear</em> (structured / dialectical / involving negation etc). This is important for later pedagogical theorists such as Dewey, Vygotsky and Piaget – Hegel&#39;s influence on these thinkers (and their general critique of mechanical learning will become clear).</li>
<li>This will hopefully become clear! We start with the idea of synthesis between machine learning and human learning, then go down several rabbit holes, before returning, in Week 8, to a modified idea of synthesis.</li>

<h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to Machine Learning and Human Learning!</p>
<p>In this course we&#39;ll be exploring these two related – but also very distinct – ideas. This week I&#39;ll provide an overview of the course, readings, approach and assessment. I&#39;ll also be introducing the work of Hegel, an Enlightenment-era German philosopher who will supply an important lens onto many of the questions posed by this new era of machine learning. </p>
<p>We&#39;ll also have a general open discussion about machine learning and human learning: what unites them, and what distinguishes them. In true dialectical fashion - a term we will get used to as we read Hegel – we will then think about what possible synthesis we might see between these two ways of learning. Part of this discussion will involve, naturally enough, a machine that will be joining us – GPT-5 – to share its views.</p>
