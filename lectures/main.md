# Hegel's Dialectical Method


## The Structure of Dialectical Thinking

### Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis

This process [@pippin2010hegel] is not merely logical but ontological, driving change and development in all spheres.

### Aufhebung (Sublation)
This crucial term means to simultaneously:
1.  Negate or abolish
2.  Preserve or keep
3.  Lift up or elevate

It captures the dynamic nature of synthesis.

### Spirit (Geist)
For Hegel, Spirit refers to the collective consciousness and culture of humanity, evolving through dialectical stages.

## Conclusion: The End of History?

For Hegel, "Absolute Knowing" represented a kind of culmination, where Spirit fully understands itself.
- This doesn't mean events stop, but that the fundamental principles of reality and freedom are comprehended.
- The ongoing dialectic continues within this achieved understanding.
