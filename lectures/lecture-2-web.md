This week we'll be introducing Hegel a little more: who was he, and why does he matter in an age of machine learning? For this course we'll be dabbling with Hegel's 1807 text The Phenomenology of Mind (or The Phenomenology of Spirit - the German word "Geist" can be translated as either mind or spirit), and this week, we'll be discussing the first section of the text, titled *Consciousness* (see below). 

The entire Hegel text really relates to experience – its alternate title was "Science of the Experience of Consciousness – but in focussing on this section on "Consciousness", we want to get an intuition about what he means specifically by "sense-experience".


### Readings

Some light-hearted orientation into the concept of experience:


 - William Blake, *Songs of Innocence and Experience*,  https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1934/1934-h/1934-h.htm

 - Jimi Hendrix, "Are You Experienced?", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMaTnZL-eM&list=RDjGMaTnZL-eM&start_radio=1 
 
  - ChatGPT, "What does Hegel mean by the concept of experience?", https://chatgpt.com/share/68b1d7a6-d984-8007-aeae-ecf3612c36ca


And something not-so-lighthearted - the part of the text we'll be discussing here:

A general hypertext copy of The Phenomenology of Spirit: - https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/phindex.htm

We'll be surveying, at a very synoptic level, 

 - "Introduction": https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/help/finintro.htm
 - "Sense-Certainty, This, & Meaning": https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phaa.htm
 - "Perception, Thing, & Deceptiveness": https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phab.htm
 - "Force & Understanding": https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phac.htm


I encourage every one to dip into the text itself - or at least the three quotes on experience below. Do not worry if this makes no sense at all! We'll be discussing this in very general terms.

People might also find this recent translation by Terry Pinchard easier to follow:

### Weekly Reflection / Comment

This week we'll begin the weekly reflection / comment (in CGScholar or CyberScholar – Michele will clarify). The key question is:

>**Can a Machine Experience?** (in the William Blake sense, the Jimi Hendrix sense, the Hegelian sense, or any other sense of "experience" you wish to consider - but cite if you do!) 

We'd like you to write 300-400 words reflection on this. By focussing on the Romantic tradition (Blake, Hendrix and Hegel are all in some sense "romantics"), we want to start from an extreme: experience is intensely human! Unreplicable by machines! But you may beg to differ, or agree in a different way... 

Tell us what you think about experience, and whether this concept distinguishes humans from machines, brings them together in a *synthesis*, or (looking ahead), differentiates between human and machinic experience, only to then bring them together...


### A couple of key Hegel quotes

(Taken from the Pinchard translation)


p. 22: 

> 36. The immediate existence of spirit, *consciousness*, has two moments, namely, knowing and the objectivity which is negative to knowing. While spirit develops itself in this element and explicates its moments therein, still this opposition corresponds to these moments, and they all come on the scene as shapes of consciousness. The science of this path is the science of the *experience* consciousness goes through. Substance is considered in the way that it and its movement are the objects of consciousness. Consciousness  knows and comprehends nothing but what is in its experience, for what is in experience is just spiritual substance, namely, as the *object* of its own self. However, spirit becomes the object, for it is this movement of becoming an *other* to *itself*, which is to say, of becoming an *object* to *its own self* and of sublating this otherness. And experience is the name of this very movement in which the immediate, the non-experienced, i.e., the abstract (whether the abstract is that of sensuous being or of “a simple” which has only been thought about) alienates itself and then comes round to itself from out of this alienation. It is only at that point that, as a property of consciousness, the immediate is exhibited in its actuality and in its truth.

p. 30:

> In everyday life, consciousness has for its content little bits of knowledge, experiences, sensuous concretions, as well as thoughts, principles, and, in general, it has its content in whatever is present, or in what counts as a fixed, stable entity or essence. In part consciousness continues on this path, and in part it interrupts the whole context through a free, arbitrary choice about such content, in which it conducts itself as if it were an external determining and manipulation of that content. It leads the content back to some kind of certainty, even if it may be only the feeling of the moment, and its conviction is satisfied when it arrives at some familiar resting place.

pp. 56-7:

> However, from this aspect not only will it be superfluous for us to add anything and not only because concept and object, the standard and what is to be examined, are present in consciousness itself. Rather, we are lifted above comparing the two and conducting a genuine *examination* such that, while consciousness examines its own self, the only thing that remains to us is purely to look on. This is so because consciousness is, on the one hand, consciousness of the object, and on the other hand, it is consciousness of its own self. It is consciousness of what, to it, is the true, as well as consciousness of its knowing of the true. While both are *for the same* consciousness, consciousness itself is their comparison. It is an issue *for that consciousness* whether or not its knowing of the object corresponds to the object. To be sure, for consciousness, the object seems to be such only in the manner that consciousness knows it; consciousness seems, as it were, to be incapable of getting behind the object to the object as it is *in itself* and not as the object is *for consciousness*. However, consciousness therefore also seems to be incapable in its own self of testing its knowing of the object. Yet precisely because consciousness knows of an object at all, there is already present the difference that something is, to consciousness, the *in-itself*, but another moment is knowing, or the being of the object *for* consciousness. It is upon this difference which is present that the testing depends. If, in this comparison, the two do not correspond to one another, then it seems as if consciousness must alter its knowing in order to make it adequate to the object. However, in knowing’s alteration, the object itself is, to consciousness, also in fact altered; for the knowing which is present was essentially a knowing of the object; along with the knowing, the object also becomes something different, for it belonged essentially to this knowing. Thus to consciousness it comes to be the case that what, to it, was previously the *in-itself*, is not in itself, or that it was *in itself* only *for consciousness*. While it therefore finds on its object’s part that its knowing does not correspond to the object, the object itself also does not endure. That is, the standard for the examination is altered when that for which it was supposed to be the standard itself fails the examination, and the examination is not only an examination of knowing but also an examination of the standard of knowing.
86. This dialectical movement which consciousness practices in its own self (as well as in its knowing and in its object), *insofar as, for consciousness, the new, true object arises* out of this movement, is properly what is called *experience*.
